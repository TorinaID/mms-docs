Traditionally, social media monitoring has relied on manual reporting, which is time-consuming and often ineffective in providing real-time insights. This challenge is exacerbated when organizations have multiple branch offices with social media activities that need to be monitored separately. Delays in obtaining information can lead to missed strategic opportunities and a lack of rapid response to emerging trends or issues. Therefore, the need for an automation system that can integrate data from various sources and provide centralized analytics has become a top priority.

The development of the Social Media Monitoring Application aims to address this need by providing a platform capable of automatically collecting data, analyzing sentiments, measuring campaign effectiveness, and providing insights accessible at all levels of the organization. This application is intended to offer greater visibility over user interactions and publication performance across social media managed by branch offices throughout Indonesia.

With the implementation of this application, organizations can expect improved operational efficiency, more data-based decision-making, and increased user engagement. Additionally, this application will enable organizations to proactively manage their online reputation and improve the services they offer to the public.
Social Media Monitoring Application aims to assist and facilitate Pulmed Humpro BNN in monitoring social media activities (Facebook, Instagram, X, YouTube, and TikTok) from BNN regions, on a single platform that can manage registered social media accounts, featuring a real-time visual dashboard and periodic reporting in the desired file format.
