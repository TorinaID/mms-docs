The landing page is specially designed to provide users with a brief overview of the MMS application. It also displays additional information such as social media posts based on the number of views or likes, from posts made by both BNN Central and regional offices.

Additionally, the landing page serves to increase the conversion rate (the effectiveness and success rate of a website in promoting its business).
